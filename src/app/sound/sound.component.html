	<div>
		<h1 style="color: white">
			<b>Background Sound</b>
		</h1>
	</div>
	<h2 style="color: white">
		<b>What is Background Sound?</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Any sound that is neutral (not soothing, not interesting, not annoying)</li>
			<li>Can be environmental sound, music, or speech</li>
		</ul>
		<b>How Can Background Sound Help?</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Our brains are “wired” to notice contrast.</li>
		</ul>
		There is a lot of contrast between tinnitus and a quiet room. Adding background sound to a quiet room reduces the contrast. The reduced contrast makes it easier to ignore tinnitus.
		<br /><br />
		<b>How does Contrast Reduction Make it Easier to Ignore Tinnitus?</b>
		<br />
		Imagine a lit candle in a dark room. The candle is the only light in the room. There is sharp contrast between the bright candle and the dark room. Therefore the candle naturally attracts a lot of attention. Next, imagine the same lit candle, but now with the lights on in the room. The contrast between the candle and the room has been reduced. The candle is just as bright as before, but attracts less attention because now there is other light in the room along with the candle.

		<br />
		The same idea applies to tinnitus. Imagine tinnitus in a quiet room. Tinnitus in a room with no other sounds naturally attracts attention. If you add background sound, your tinnitus will be just as loud as before. However it won’t attract as much attention because of the other sound in the room along with the tinnitus. Adding background sound creates an environment where it is easier for the tinnitus to go unnoticed.
		<br /><br />

		<br />
		Note: Sometimes Background Sound helps right away. Sometimes it takes weeks or months before you notice it is helping.
		<br /><br />
		<b>When can I use Background Sound?</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Any time your tinnitus bothers you</li>
		</ul>
		A constant background of sound can help you notice your tinnitus less often. Background Sound should always be set to a comfortable loudness level. The sound should become a natural part of your day.
